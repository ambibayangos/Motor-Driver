# Magnetic concepts
- Permeance (the flux "conductivity") - high for permeable materials such as electrical metal (iron with silicon), ferrite.
- Reluctance (the "flux "resistivity") - low permeability materials have higher reluctance. Air gap create a lot of relunctance in a magnetic circuit.
- Back EMF and Torque are related (if you know one, you can compute the other)

# Number of Magnet Poles
- More magnet poles means more torque for the same applied current.
- Nunmber of magenet poles limited by space


# Magnets
- The magnets wants to have a high permeance coefficient (4-5) to prevent demagnetisation
- The magnet Br (magnetic flux density at no excitation) drops as temperature increases. The higher the temp the magnet looses its magnetisation.
- The permeance coefficient of the magnet depends on the airgap, magnet vollume, as well as their cross sectional area.
